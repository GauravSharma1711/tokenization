Custom JavaScript Tokenizer Demo
This is a simple, self-contained web application that demonstrates a custom tokenizer built entirely with vanilla JavaScript. It allows users to train a vocabulary from a block of text, then encode and decode new text using the learned vocabulary. The project is designed to be easy to set up and evaluate, with all code contained in three standard web files.

Project Overview
The tokenizer is a basic implementation that serves as a foundational example. It tokenizes text by splitting on spaces and punctuation, builds a unique vocabulary of these tokens, and assigns a unique integer ID to each. It also includes special tokens, such as <|endoftext|> and <|pad|>, which are common in real-world tokenizers used for large language models.

Features
Vocabulary Training: Learn a vocabulary from any provided text.

ENCODE: Convert human-readable text into a sequence of integer tokens.

DECODE: Convert a sequence of integer tokens back into text.

Special Tokens: Handles predefined special tokens and assigns them the lowest IDs.

Simple UI: A clean, single-page interface for easy interaction and demonstration.

Setup Instructions
The project is designed to be run locally without any build tools or dependencies.

Create a new folder for the project.

Inside this folder, create three files: index.html, style.css, and script.js.

Copy and paste the code from the corresponding Canvas documents into each file.

Open index.html in any modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge) to run the application.

Usage
The web application is split into three main sections to guide you through the process.

1. Train Vocabulary
Paste a block of text into the "Training Text" textarea.

Click the "Build Vocabulary" button.

An alert will confirm that the vocabulary has been built, and the "Vocabulary" section at the bottom will display the token-to-ID mappings.

2. Encode & Decode
With the vocabulary built, you can now use the "Encode & Decode" section.

Enter new text into the "Enter text to tokenize" textarea.

Click the "Encode" button. The resulting token IDs will appear in the "Tokens (Editable)" textarea.

To see the decode functionality, click the "Decode" button. The original text will be reconstructed in the "Decoded Text" display area.

3. View Results
The bottom section of the page provides a real-time view of the tokenizer's state.

Tokens (Editable): Shows the raw integer IDs from the encoding process. You can manually edit these IDs and click "Decode" to see the result.

Decoded Text: Displays the text output from the decoding process.

Vocabulary: A full list of all learned tokens and their corresponding integer IDs, including the special tokens. The size of the vocabulary is also displayed here.

Code Structure
The project code is separated into three files for clarity and maintainability:

index.html: The main HTML file that defines the page structure and includes the CSS and JavaScript files. It also loads the Tailwind CSS CDN for styling.

style.css: Contains custom CSS rules that complement the Tailwind classes, such as font family, background colors, and button transitions.

script.js: Contains all the application logic, including the SimpleTokenizer class and the functions that handle user interactions and UI updates.
